Suddenly you're forgetting names mid-conversation, re-reading emails three times, and hitting a mental wall every afternoon.\n\nYour doctor says it's normal. But you know your brain — and this isn't you.\n\nThe truth? Declining estrogen reduces acetylcholine and serotonin production in your brain, the neurotransmitters responsible for memory, focus, and mental energy.\n\nYou don't need to \"accept\" brain fog. You need to support your brain through this hormonal shift.";
